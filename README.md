# SoccerTeams
Built with Spring Framework, SportsTeams allows users to manage, sort and search sports team data from a database. GET, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE RESTful calls are made to the database to manage data. Backend logic is written in Java, and the front end uses Javascript with HTML and CSS.
